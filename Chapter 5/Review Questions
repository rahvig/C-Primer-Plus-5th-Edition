1. Whats the difference between an entry condition loop and exit condition loop. Which kind is each of the C++ Loops
An entry condition loop will only execute if its condition is true,
an exit condition loop is guaranteed to execute at least once and exits only when the exit condition is false.
while - entry
do while - exit
for - entry

2. Code will print
01234

3.
0369 //exit loop
j is 12 at the end.

4. Code will print
6
8


5. Code will print
k = 8

6.  for(int i = 1; i <= 64;  i *= 2){
      cout << i << endl;
    }

7. Enclose it in brackets

8. int x = (1,024); //x is assigned the hexidecimal value of 024 which is 20 in decimal.
y = 1,024. //y is assigned 1 and 024 does nothing, but is still evaluated.

9. How does cin >> ch differ from cin.get(ch) and ch = cin.get() in how it views input?
The cin >> ch skips over whitespace, newlines and tabs when it encounters them. The other two forms read those characters
